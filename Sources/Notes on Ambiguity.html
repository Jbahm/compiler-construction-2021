There are two types of ambiguity: Genuine ambiguities, where a sentence
really can have two different meanings to an intelligent hearer,
and "computer" ambiguities, where the meaning is entirely clear to
a hearer but a computer detects more than one meaning.  Genuine 
ambiguity is not a serious problem for NLP problems; it's comparatively
rare, and you can't expect computers to do better with natural language
than people.  Computer ambiguity is a very serious problem; it is
extremely common, and it is where computers do much much worse than
humans. 

<h3>Types of ambiguity</h3>

<h4> Lexical ambiguity </h4>
Words have multiple meanings. <br>
"I saw a bat."  <br>
bat = flying mammal / wooden club? <br>
saw = past tense of "see" / 
present tense of "saw" (to cut with a saw.)
    

<h4> Syntactic ambiguity.</h4>
A sentence has multiple parse trees. <br>
Particularly common sources of ambiguity in English are: 

<p><b> Phrase attachment.</b> 
"Mary ate a salad with spinach from Califonia for lunch on Tuesday." <br>
"with spinach" can attach to "salad" or "ate" <br>
"from California" can attach to "spinach", "salad", or "ate". <br>
"for lunch" can attach to "California", "spinach", "salad", or "ate" <br>
and "on Tuesday" can attach to "lunch", "California", "spinach", "salad"
or "ate".  <br>
(Crossovers are not allowed, so you cannot both attach "on Tuesday" to 
"spinach" and attach "for lunch" to salad.  Nonetheless there are 42
possible different parse trees.)`



</p><p> <b> Conjunction. </b>
"Mary ate a salad with spinach from Califonia for lunch on Tuesday and 
Wednesday." <br>

"Wednesday" can be conjoined with salad, spinach, California, lunch, or
Tuesday.

</p><p>
<b> Noun group structure </b>
English allows long series of nouns to be strung together using the
incredibly ambiguous rule NG -&gt; NG NG.  E.g.
"New York University Martin Luther King Jr. scholarship program
projects coordinator Susan Reid".  Even taking "New York" "Martin
Luther King Jr." and "Susan Reid" to be effectively single elements,
this is 8 elements in a row, and has 429 possible parses.

</p><p>
For a while, I was collecting these as an assignment from students;
I saved some of the best in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/ai/compound-nouns.txt"> Examples
of Compound Nouns </a>


</p><h4>Semantic ambiguity. </h4>
Even after the syntax and the meanings of the 
individual words have been resolved, there are two ways of reading the 
sentence.

"Lucy owns a parrot that is larger than a cat", "a parrot"
is extenstensionally quantified, "a cat" is either universally quantified
or means "typical cats."

Other examples: <br>
"The dog is chasing the cat." vs. "The dog has been domesticated
for 10,000 years." In the first sentence, "The dog" means to a particular
dog; in the second, it means the species "dog".

<p>
"John and Mary are married." (To each other? or separately?)
Compare "John and Mary got engaged last month. Now, John and Mary are married."
vs. "Which of the men at this party are single? John and Jim are married;
the rest are all available."

</p><p>
"John kissed his wife, and so did Sam". (Sam kissed John's wife or his own?)

</p><p> 
Compare "Amy's car", "Amy's husband", "Amy's greatest fear", 
"Michaelangelo's <em>David</em>" etc.

</p><p>
The relation of the meaning of a compound noun to its component can be 
vary wildly.  See <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/ai/compound-nouns.txt"> Compound Nouns </a>
for examples.

</p><h4>Anaphoric ambiguity.  </h4>
A phrase or word refers to something previously
mentioned, but there is more than one possibility.

<p>
"Margaret invited Susan for a visit, and she gave her a good lunch."
(she = Margaret; her = Susan)

</p><p>
"Margaret invited Susan for a visit, but she told her she had to go to work"
(she = Susan; her = Margaret.)

</p><p>
"On the train to Boston, George chatted with another passenger. The man
turned out to be a professional hockey player." (The man = another passenger).

</p><p>
"Bill told Amy that he had decided to spend a year in Italy to study art." <br>
"That would be his life's work." (That = art) <br>
"After he had done that, he would come back and marry her." 
    (That = spending a year in Italy) <br>
"That was the upshot of his thinking the previous night" (That = deciding) <br>
"That started a four-hour fight." (That = telling Amy) <br>

</p><p>
In many cases, there is no explicit antecedent.

</p><p>
"I went to the hospital, and they told me to go home and rest." 
   (They = the hospital staff.)


</p><h4> Non-literal speech.</h4>
"The White House announced today that ..." ("White House" = the Presidents's 
staff) (Mentonymy) <br>
<p>
"The price of tomatoes in Des Moines has gone through the roof" 
   (= increased greatly) Metaphor.

</p><h4> Ellipsis </h4>
The omission of words that are needed for grammatical completion, and are
"understood".  This is very common in speech, less so in writing.

E.g. "I am allergic to tomatoes.  Also fish."  Understood as 
"I am also allergic to fish" rather than "Also, fish are allergic to tomatoes."

"Mozart was born in Salzburg and Beethoven, in Bonn". Understood as 
"Mozart was born in Salzburg and Beethoven was born in Bonn" 


<!--
<H4> Ambiguity in textual connections</H4>

"John slumped down in his chair with a beer, in front of the evening news.
He was tired." (i.e. when he slumped)

"John worked for fourteen hours on the Foster project, and then was stuck
in a traffic jam coming home. He was tired." (i.e. after working and being
stuck). 

<H4> Ambiguity of user intent</H4>

<p>
"Do you know what time it is?" (= "Please tell me what time it is" or
                                  sometimes "You are very late.")
    Indirect speech act.

<h3> Extended example </h3>

A perfectly typical, not contrivedly literary, actual example, from
"Nice disguise: Alito's frightening geniality" by Andrew M. Siegel
(The New Republic 11/14/05). 

<blockquote>
  If you are a fan of the justices who fought throughout the Rehnquist years
  to pull the Supreme Court to the right, Alito is a home run --- a strong
  and consistent conservative with the skill to craft opinions that make
  radical results appear inevitable and the ability to build trusting
  professional relationships across ideological lines.
</blockquote>

<p>
Metaphors: "fought", "pull to the right", "home run", "craft", "build", 
"across ... lines".  (Probably "home run" was the only conscious use of a 
metaphor.)  

</p><p>
Lexical ambiguities: "fan", "strong", "consistent", arguably "conservative",
"opinions", "results", "inevitable", "professional".  (The line between 
metaphor and lexical ambiguity is very unclear.)

</p><p>
Syntactic ambiguities: Does "who fought ..." attach to "fan" or
"justices"? Does "to the right" attach to "Court", "pull", "years",
"fought", "justices" or "fan"?  Is "and the ability" conjoined to
"opinions" or "the skill" or "conservative"? Does "across ideological lines" 
attach to "relationships" or "build"?  (The last is an example of the 
phenomenon, not at all rare, of an ambiguity that makes no actual difference; 
the meaning of either reading is the same.) 

</p><p>
Anaphoric ambiguity: Who are the implicit subject and object of "trusting"?

</p><p>
Semantic ambiguity: "the skill ... the ability": Do these denote unique
ontological entities?  If not, what do they denote?


</p><p>
The hardest part is to find the logical structure, which is, I would argue,
"Since Alito is a strong and consistent conservative ... therefore
if you are a fan ... then your opinion should be that Alito is a home
run."  Notice that "your opinion should be" is omitted in the sentence;
the linguistic practice of deleting elements and leaving them implicit
is known as ellipsis.  Notice also that though syntactically
"home run" and "strong and consistent conservative" are in apposition,
logically they are entirely separate.  The author is presenting it as fact
that Alito is a strong and consistent conservative with the skill etc. but
that Alito is a "home run" is not a fact, it is the presumed opinion of
the hypothetical "you".

</p><h4> Example 2 </h4>
<blockquote>
Elsie tried to reach her aunt on the phone, but she didn't answer.
</blockquote>
<p>
Lexical ambiguity: The word "tried" means "attempted" not "held a court proceedings", or "test" (as in "Elsie tried the lemonade"). The word "reach" means
"establish communication" not "physically arrive at" (as in "the boat reached
the shore"). 
</p><p>
Syntatic ambiguity: The phrase "on the phone" attaches to "reach" and thus 
means "using the phone" not to "aunt" which would mean "her aunt who was 
physically on top of the phone" (compare "her aunt in Seattle").
</p><p>
Anaphoric ambiguity: "she" means the aunt, not Elsie. 


</p><h3> Techniques of ambiguity resolution.</h3>

<h4>
<b>Syntactic constraints.</b></h4>

<h4> Frequency. </h4>
(Particularly for lexical ambiguity.) Prefer the most common
meaning of a word.
   "I saw the table."  "saw" = past tense of see is much more common than
                       "saw" = present tense "cut with a saw."

<h4> Frequency in context. </h4>
    In context = dinner, "pitcher" means "container of liquid" <br>
    In context = baseball, "pitcher" means "thrower of ball."

<h4> Associational frequency </h4>
Make a judgement based on how often two words, or particular meanings of word,
appear in text.

<p>
<b>Examples:</b>
"The cheetah caught up with the sheep because <em>it</em> was very fast."
"Fast" is more associated with "cheetah" than "sheep" so "it" is more likely
to refer to "cheetah".

</p><p>
"I hammer the nail and I saw the board". "Saw" the tool is strongly associated
with "hammer" and "nail", so that interpretation would be preferred. 



</p><h4>Selectional restrictions. (= semantic constraints)</h4> 
Concept A can only combine with concept B
in mode Z if A or B have specified features.

<p>
E.g. "The bat ate its dinner." The subject of "ate" is generally animate.
Therefore "bat" means "flying mammal" not "wooden club."

</p><p>
"The sick bat lay on the ground."  The adjective "sick" generally modifies
animate objects. Hence "bat" = flying mammal.

</p><p>
"The broken bat lay on the ground." The adjective "broken" generally modifies
inanimate objects. Hence "bat" is a wooden club.

</p><p>
"The clock is fast." vs "The horse is fast." vs. "The clothes are fast." vs.
"The slopes are fast." vs. "The knot is fast." <br>
"fast" meaning "showing a time later than correct." applies only to a 
    time-piece. <br>
"fast" meaning "speedy" applies only to a mobile object. <br>
"fast" meaning "trendy" applies only to an object of conspicuous display.. <br>
"fast" meaning "inducing speedy movement" applies only to a context of 
    movement. <br>
"fast" meaning "secure" applies only to a fastening.

</p><p>
"The horse ran up the hill. It was very steep." vs. "It soon got tired."<br>
"Steep" applies to surfaces, hence "it" = hill. <br>
"Tired" applies to animate objects; hence "it" = horse. 

</p><p>
"I went to the hospital on 13th street" vs. "on Wednesday" <br>
"on <time>" cannot modify an object. Hence "on Wenesday" is part of the VP.


</time></p><h4>Recency rule (for anaphora).</h4> 85% of the time of so, the referent is
the most recently mentioned object of correct gender and number.

<h4> Parallel structure.</h4> (Mostly for anaphora)
"John met Mike on the street, and he asked him to dinner." (He = John; 
him = Mike).

<h4> World knowledge.</h4> Prefer the most plausible interpretation. <br>
"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they
advocated violence." vs. <br>
"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they
feared violence."  (Terry Winograd, <em> Understanding Natural Language</em>).


<p>
"I went up to the door of the house with the red shutters."

</p><p>
"Margaret invited Susan for a visit, and she gave her a good lunch."

</p><p>
"Margaret invited Susan for a visit, but she told her she had to go to work"

</p><p>
"Harry scratched his head, and so did Mike."

</p><h4> Textual coherence </h4>
<p>
"President Bush announced yesterday that he is nominating Michael Mukasey for
attorney general.  He said he is a great American." (Note that it is not 
inherently more plausible that Bush should say this about Mukasey than vice
versa, but the narrative context disambiguates it.)


</p><h4>Speaker intent.</h4> Interpret the text in a way that gives a reason
for the speaker to say it.

"Pardon me. Do you know what time it is?" <br>
"You promised you would be back by 11:00. Do you know what time it is?"

<p>
"Elsie tried to reach her aunt on the phone, but she didn't answer."
Disambiguating "she" requires combining world knowledge with speaker intent.
First, you need to know how telephone calls work: one person initiates the call,
the other person may or may not answer; the communication is successful (the
caller reaches the callee) only if the second person does answer. Second, you
have to use a rule, called a Gricean rule, that, when people say or write 
thintgs, they try to give you new information, not old information. In this
case, since the sentence already said that Elsie made the call, there is
no point in saying that she didn't answer it; the caller is never the 
person who answers a call. What is useful information is that the aunt didn't
answer.
