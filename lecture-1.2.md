# Finite Automata as a Specification Language

The aim of this lecture is not yet to introduce the theory of fintie automata (that will come later), but to give you just enough background so that you can apply finite automata to the solution of [Assignment 1](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SyzUgMabU).

## Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs)

We follow Chapter 2.2 of [Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation](https://mcdtu.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/introduction-to-automata-theory.pdf).

- Section 2.2.1: Definition of DFA  
- Section 2.2.2: How a DFA Processes Strings  
- Section 2.2.3: Transition Diagrams  
- Section 2.2.4: Extending the Transition Function to Strings   
- Section 2.2.5: The Language of a DFA  

I recommend that you **take your own notes** during the lecture, but everything you need to know (and much more) is in the book.

## Homework

(Homework is not assessed, so feel free to discuss the exercises and solutions on the discussion forum.)

The listed exercises from the book are relevant preparation for **tests and final**. 


**Mandatory:** 

- Read Section 2.1 of the book for general background.
- Study Sections 2.2.1-2.2.5 and remember the definitions.
- Read the box on page 52 of the book extra carefully.
- Do the following exercises: 
  - Exercise 2.2.4 
  - Exercise 2.2.10 (the proof is optional)
- Post a reply to my homework question on the discussion forum.

  
**Optional:**

- Exercises 2.2.5 and 2.2.6
- Exercise 2.2.11 (You don't need to do a formal prove by induction but think about an argument showing that your language is the correct one.)
