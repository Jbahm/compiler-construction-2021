# Finite Automata as a Specification Language

In class we discussed the task of [searching for a string](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Sk555wUlu) in text.

Time permitting, we also looked at  [A Short Introduction to Automata and Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP).

## Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs)

We follow Chapter 2.2 of [Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation](https://mcdtu.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/introduction-to-automata-theory.pdf).

- Section 2.2.1: Definition of DFA  
- Section 2.2.2: How a DFA Processes Strings  
- Section 2.2.3: Transition Diagrams  
- Section 2.2.4: Extending the Transition Function to Strings   
- Section 2.2.5: The Language of a DFA  

I recommend that you **take your own notes** during the lecture, but everything you need to know (and much more) is in the book.

## Homework

(Homework is not assessed, so feel free to discuss the exercises and solutions on the discussion forum.)

The listed exercises from the book are relevant preparation for **tests and final**. 


**Mandatory:** 

- Read Section 2.1 of the book for general background.
- Study Sections 2.2.1-2.2.5 and remember the definitions.
- Read the box on page 52 of the book extra carefully.
- Do the following exercises: 
  - Exercise 2.2.4 
  - Exercise 2.2.10 (the proof is optional)
- Post a reply to my homework question on the discussion forum.

  
**Optional:**

- Exercises 2.2.5 and 2.2.6
- Exercise 2.2.11 (You don't need to do a formal prove by induction but think about an argument showing that your language is the correct one.)
