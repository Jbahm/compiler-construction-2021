## Course Description 

This course teaches compiler construction not as a low level machine language oriented course but as a high level software engineering course. The aim is to give students the means to design and implement their own domain specific language (DSL). The [quote](http://wiki.c2.com/?DomainSpecificLanguage)

        Any sufficiently large software project becomes a DSL by virtue of the
        library of functions built up to implement the solution to the specific
        problem the project was conceived to address. 

indicates how DSLs are related to software engineering in general.

While writing a fully fledged compiler is a big task beyond what we can do in a one semester course, with a good mix of theory based software engineering tools, it is well in the scope of a semester to learn how to create a grammar, parser, typechecker, interpreter and code generator for a small but realistic programming language. In our case, we choose a fragment of C++, which should be familiar to many students and emphasises that the taught methods apply to real existing mainstream programming languages.

## Late Policy
If you need more time for an assignment that may be possible if
- you can prove to me that you already have done work on the assignment (for example by showing me code in your GitHub repository);
- you can explain the special circumstances that make you ask for more time.

## Participation

- It is expected that students attend every lecture and participate in the [Discussion Forum](https://groups.google.com/g/chapman-compiler-construction-2021). 
- I also appreciate if students make use of the office hours, which gives me valuable feedback on how the class is going.
- Participation will contribute 4% to the final course grade, see [Assessment](assessment.md).

## Exams
