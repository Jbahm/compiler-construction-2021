**Homework** is essential preparation for midterm and final but not graded. Ask any questions on the discussion forum. **Excursions** are optional.

## Part 1: Lexing and Finite Automata.

In the first week we find that automata are a good specification language to specify algorithms searching for patterns in text.

- L1.1: [Searching for Strings](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Sk555wUlu). Don't forget the [Homework](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rycnvMvgu).

- L1.2: Answers to homework questions. [Introduction to Automata and Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP). Excursion on [*Why do Java and Python not have goto statements?*](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJ5wS-0f8). Practice what you have learned with this important [Homework](homework-1.2.md).

Coming soon: What do we do if the DFAs get too complicated? We need a specification language for DFAs ... Composing Automata ... Regular Expressions ...
