# Lecture by Lecture 

**Homework** is essential preparation for midterm and final but not graded. Ask any questions on the discussion forum. **Excursions** are optional.

## Part 1: Lexing and Finite Automata

In the first week we find that automata are a good specification language to specify algorithms searching for patterns in text.

- L1.1: [Searching for Strings](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Sk555wUlu). Don't forget the [Homework](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rycnvMvgu).

- L1.2: Answers to homework questions. [Introduction to Automata and Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP). Excursion on [*Why do Java and Python not have goto statements?*](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJ5wS-0f8) Practice what you have learned with this important [Homework](homework-1.2.md).

In the second week we go one level up, from automata as a specification language for search algorithms to regular expressions as a specification language for automata (and languages).

- L2.1: [Composing Automata (with Homework)](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ryV_FU7XI) ... [Handwritten notes from the lecture](Sources/Notes-from-the-lecture-Composing-Automata.pdf) ... 

- L2.2: [Regular Expressions](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HkoNj8mmU) ... [Handwritten notes from the lecture](Sources/Notes-from-lecture-2.2.pdf) ... [Homework](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/S1EVYe7bO) ...  

- L3.1: Continued from last lecture's [Regular Expressions](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HkoNj8mmU). We reviewed Exercises 2.5.3.b and c from [the previous homework](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/S1EVYe7bO) in detail and then discussed the algorithm converting an NFA to a DFA. For a summary of the lecture as well as practice question see the new [homework](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HJ1BAFYbd).

<!--
For midterm and final the most relevant skills from Part 1 are:
- equivalence of regular expressions and non-determinstic finite automata, 
- the algorithm that eliminates epsilon-transitions,
- the algorithm that converts NFAs to DFAs
